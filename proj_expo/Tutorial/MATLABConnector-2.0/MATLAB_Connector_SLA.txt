and its third party licensors shall have no liability for any indirect or 
consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and including loss 
of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, and loss of use of any 
computer hardware or software).  Some states do not allow the exclusion 
or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
